## Goals

We have several goals that will be included in our final system:
* Users will be able to upload and share recipes
* Recipes can be filtered according to dietary restrictions
* Recipes will have an estimated cost per serving, number of servings, and estimated time to cook
* Vendors will be able to login and establish a profile
  * Include stock, cost, location, and hours
* Admin users will be able to login
  * Edit content, remove content, and verify vendor users

# Development History

Development of Constrained Cooking followed practices of [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s18/modules/project-management/).  Milestones are used to track the progress on groups of issues; they consist of tasks that take 2-3 days.  To manage progress within a Milestone, GitHub projects are created with three columns corresponding to: Backlog, In Progress, and Done.

This milestone started on April 2, 2018 and ended on ...

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create mockup pages of what we expect the final system to look like.  Below are layouts of the main recipe page, add recipe page, vendor stock page, and the user profile page.
